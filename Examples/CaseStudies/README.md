# Case Studies

This project includes a number of digestible examples of how to solve common problems using
SharingFirestore, including:

  * [SwiftUI Query](SwiftUIQueryDemo.swift): Shows how to use the tools of this library directly in a SwiftUI
    view to query Firestore collections.
  * [SwiftUI Sync](SwiftUISyncDemo.swift): Shows how to use the sync tools of this library directly in a SwiftUI
    view to create bidirectional data flow with Firestore.
  * [Dynamic Queries](DynamicQuery.swift): Shows how to dynamically change the parameters of a Firestore
    query, such as when searching for documents containing specific text.
  * [@Observable Models](ObservableModelDemo.swift): Shows how to use the tools of this library
    in an `@Observable` model to connect with Firestore.
